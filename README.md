Primitive roots

In modular arithmetic, a  primitive root is described as a number d modulo n such that for every integer y coprime to n, there is some integer x for which d<sup>x</sup>  â‰¡ y (mod n). 
The value x is termed as the index or discrete logarithm of y to the base d modulo n. 
In other words, g is a primitive root modulo n if and only if g is a generator of the multiplicative group of integers modulo n.
